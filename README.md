# One of Those Days
Web Sound Project 

## Documentation

This 3.5-minute sound piece takes the listener on a journey: to one of "those" days. The goal of this piece is to demonstrate how each day - A and B, in this case - can be different from the mental health perspective.

The story unfolds as the protagonist of the sound-piece progresses through their day performing different activities. From waking up with the sounds of an alarm to finishing the day off under the night sky, the protagonist is either energetic and excited or anxious and exhausted from their agenda.

My project partner (Matthew Varona) and I have recorded all of the sounds. The primary software used during editing the piece is Audacity. Utilizing different tools and effects like fading in and out, distortion and EQ, we were able to get the final result. To enhance the storytelling effect of "good" and "bad" days, we added originally composed music in Logic Pro X to the piece. One of the primary constraints during recording all of the audio pieces was, of course, lack of proper equipment. However, we were able to work this around using our cell phone microphones.

The complete project is hosted on the web. In order to convey the best user experience and add some interactivity, we have added the day/night simulation using p5.js and tracking mouseX and mouseY positions. Digital accessibility is also something we have considered by adding closed captions with audio description to the users who are not able to listen to the piece. The decision to make a simple web design was also made on purpose - to make an emphasis on audio experience instead of the web.

Overall, I think we were able to push ourselves creatively to convey the theme of the piece as well as provide an alternative experience for people who interact with audio differently.
